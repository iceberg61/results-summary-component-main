## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Sometimes flexbox can be a real drag, so i had to go and solidify my knowledge about flexbox and grid.
And i made a rule for myself -----> only use flex for alignment and grid for layout
